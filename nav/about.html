          <h3>Project Goals</h3>
          <p>This site extends anatomical study into a digital, research-oriented archive. It emphasizes observation and layered learning — tracing the progression from gesture to structure, surface to depth.</p>
          <p>The archive is organized into three main areas:</p>
          <ul class="influences-list">
            <li><strong>Anatomy Archive</strong> — Interactive figure studies with layered overlays revealing gesture, skeleton, and muscle beneath the surface</li>
            <li><strong>Cabinet of Texture</strong> — Process fragments collected from the studio: smudge, paper, lines, medium, residue, and compositional designs</li>
            <li><strong>Timeline</strong> — A 14-week chronological journey documenting the evolution of observation, technique, and anatomical understanding</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>About the Artist</h3>

          <h3>Course Context</h3>
          <p>This project bridges two disciplines: figure drawing and web design.</p>
  
          <h4>Figure Drawing</h4>
          <p>The artwork in this archive explores line, shape, value, texture, composition, perspective, volume, and space as applied to figure drawing. Through a variety of drawing media and mark-making techniques, this work develops accurate observational skills while learning the basics of anatomy and human proportion. The studies reflect both historical and contemporary approaches to figurative art.</p>
  
          <h4>Web Design</h4>
          <p>Built with HTML and CSS, this site translates studio practice into digital form — organizing drawings, process fragments, and weekly progressions into an interactive archive.</p>
